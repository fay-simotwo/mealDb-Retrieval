# MealDB API Retrieval Script
This Python script allows you to make requests to the MealDB API and retrieve information about meals. The script supports retrieving data from the API and handling cases where the API response may not be valid JSON.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The requests library installed. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install requests
```
## Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the script file (meal.py) to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Run the script using the following command:
```
python meal.py
```
## Usage
The script sends a GET request to the MealDB API.

It checks if the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request).

If the response status code is 200, it attempts to parse the JSON response.

If parsing fails, it prints an error message indicating that the API may not have returned valid JSON.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the script or the API response, consider the following steps:
Check the API documentation to ensure you are using the correct endpoint and request parameters.
Verify the API response by printing the response text to see its content.
Contact the API provider for support if you suspect issues with the API itself.
